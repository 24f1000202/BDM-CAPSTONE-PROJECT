Financial Resilience Assessment & Risk Simulator

This project presents a data-driven financial risk assessment of a fleet-based commercial transport business with ₹9+ crore debt exposure. The objective was to evaluate debt sustainability, revenue concentration risk, and GST compliance integrity using quantitative analysis and scenario-based stress testing.

🔍 Problem Scope

The business faced:
1.High EMI obligations affecting liquidity
2.Heavy revenue concentration among top clients
3.GST mismatches and data integrity gaps

📊 Analytical Framework

1.The analysis integrates two structured datasets (fleet financing + sales/GST records) and implements:
2.Vehicle-level DSCR modeling under pessimistic, base, and optimistic revenue scenarios
3.Client concentration analysis using Pareto analysis, ABC classification, and Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)
4.GST anomaly detection using statistical deviation thresholds (±2 standard deviation rule)
5.Risk tier classification for decision-oriented intervention

🛠 Tech Stack

1.Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
2.Statistical modeling
3.Data cleaning & preprocessing
4.React-based interactive dashboard

Deployed on Vercel

🌐 Interactive Prototype
An interactive financial stress simulator was built to allow scenario-based testing of:
1.Revenue contraction
2.EMI stress
3.Client loss impact
4.GST compliance risk
